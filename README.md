This example Python Script "K5 Project List Generator.py" can be used to create a text file called "projectlist.txt", that includes a list of project IDs for your K5 contact. This scriptÂ will authenticate you against the global region, obtain a list of all regions, then for each region obtain a token and write the project ids to a file, one per line:

Before using the script, please edit it and update the Contract Parameters with your user credentials. Note: Ensure the account you use is a member of the DomainManager group.

Project IDs are written to the file as shown in the below example snippet:
